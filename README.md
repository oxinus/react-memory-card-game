in this project we got 6 paired cars.
every time you click on the cards it flippes to front-face.
after you click on two cards, if two cards matched together they will stay flipped and if they don't, they flipp on the initial state (turn back to unflipped).
try to remember cards to find them all soon.
after you find it all you got a "you won" message and it will be refreshed
